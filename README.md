# Classify.ai

A personalized teacher, note-taker and summarizer to accompany all students in their journey to academic and social success!

## Inspiration
With more students touched by ADHD and other concentration problems, the educational system has had difficulty adapting... but we haven't!
## What it does
Inspired by the Feynman method, Classif.ai transcribes, summarizes, and returns a neat point-formatted set of notes, to help YOU study your lectures better!

Steps: 
1. Send your audio, it could be an MP3 file, a transcript, OR, you can even LIVE RECORD the lecture you are attending.

2. WAIT a few minutes, and let the magic happen! The transformers on the flask backend are now working hard to transcribe speech to text, and to effectively summarize and reformat YOUR newest lecture notes!

Enjoy!
## What's next for Classif.ai
We are currently working on a flash cards feature, where, from the same transcript, audio file, or lecture themselves, we can return a set of flashcards, to help study subjects such as Anatomy, Medicine, and biology!

We are also working on implement more language and image recognition models, to be able to read powerpoint lectures, and other blackboards!
